# Monkey

C# implementation of the Monkey language from "Writing an Interpreter in Go"

I found coding a C# implementation of the Go Interpreter helped in understanding the demonstrated concepts, as I worked my way through the book. It was a process to help me work through the book.

This served it's purpose, is write once, read never. I have never rationalized the design nor code.
